**Maintained by:** Rahim Khoja ([khoja1@ualberta.ca](mailto:khoja1@ualberta.ca)) 

## üß∞ Description

This repository contains the source code and Kubernetes deployment for Helpy ‚Äî a containerized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built to support users on Digital Research Alliance of Canada HPC clusters.

Helpy answers user questions about Slurm job scheduling, software environments, module usage, and Alliance-specific documentation. It supports multiple large language model (LLM) providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, GroqCloud, Google AI, and Ollama, and retrieves knowledge from vector databases like RAGFlow and (soon) Google Agent.

The backend is Flask-based with optional WebSocket streaming and supports integration with Slack, Google Chat, and other future UIs through modular route extensions.

**Note:** *This project was initially developed and donated to the University of Alberta by Rahim Khoja.*

The image is automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the `latest` branch.

**Docker Hub:** [rkhoja/chatbot-rag-alliance\:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/rkhoja/chatbot-rag-alliance)

```bash
docker pull rkhoja/chatbot-rag-alliance:latest
```

### üèóÔ∏è What's Inside

Update the contents list to reflect chatbot components:

This container includes:

* Flask + Flask-SocketIO web server
* LangChain with support for OpenAI, Groq, Claude, and Ollama providers
* Vector search integration with RAGFlow or Weaviate
* Prebuilt routes for user input, chat state, and WebSocket sessions
* Markdown rendering, streaming responses, and token budgeting
* Prompt templating system and persona switching via external text files

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Actions - CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-warewulf-proxmox.yml`.

### üîÑ What It Does

* Builds the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`
* Logs into Docker Hub using stored GitHub Secrets
* Pushes the image tagged as the current branch (usually `latest`)

### ‚úÖ Setting Up GitHub Secrets

To enable pushing to your Docker Hub:

1. Go to your fork's GitHub repo ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Add the following:

   * `DOCKER_HUB_REPO` ‚Üí your Docker Hub repo. In this case: *rkhoja/warewulf-proxmox* 
   * `DOCKER_HUB_USER` ‚Üí your Docker Hub username
   * `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` ‚Üí create a [Docker Hub access token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)

### üöÄ Manual Trigger & Auto-Build

* Manual: Run the workflow from the **Actions** tab with **Run workflow** (enabled via `workflow_dispatch`).
* Automatic: Any push to the `latest` branch triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

* **Recommended branching model:**
  * Work and test in `main`
  * Merge or fast-forward `main` to `latest` to trigger a production build

```bash
git checkout latest
git merge main
git push origin latest
```
